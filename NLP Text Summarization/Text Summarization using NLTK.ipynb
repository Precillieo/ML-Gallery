    "# Diwali Essay Example\n",
    "text = \"\"\"The religious significance of this festival has differences. It varies from one region to another in India. There is an association of many deities, cultures, and traditions with Diwali. The reason for these differences is probably local harvest festivals. Hence, there was a fusion of these harvest festivals into one pan-Hindu festival.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Ramayana, Diwali is the day of the return of Rama. This day Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya along with his wife Sita. This return was made after Rama defeated demon King Ravana. Furthermore, Rama’s brother Lakshmana and Hanuman also came back to Ayodhya victorious.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another popular tradition for the reason of Diwali. Here Lord Vishnu as an incarnation of Krishna killed Narakasura. Narakasura was certainly a demon. Above all, this victory brought the release of 16000 captive girls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this victory shows the triumph of good over evil. This is due to Lord Krishna being good and Narakasura being evil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association of Diwali to Goddess Lakshmi is the belief of many Hindus. Lakshmi is the wife of Lord Vishnu. She also happens to be the Goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a legend, Diwali is the night of Lakshmi wedding. This night she chose and wed Vishnu. Eastern India Hindus associate Diwali with Goddess Durga or kali. Some Hindus believe Diwali to be the start of a new year.\"\"\""
